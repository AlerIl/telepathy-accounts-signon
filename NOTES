Ch.I.CredentialsStorage is disabled, since it's not an official interface
and would be difficult to compile. From what I know, it's only useful if we
wish to be able to store credentials provided to telepathy and unrelated to
any libaccounts account in libsignon, which isn't relevant for the use case
here.
